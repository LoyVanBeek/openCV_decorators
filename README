Wrapper for the python-port of the openCV-library. 

The OpenCV python bindings are much alike the C and C++ interface. 
These wrappers allow for faster prototyping of applications, because it will take care of the instantiation of resources OpenCV's functions need. 
It also allows to chain functions into a pipeline for processing images.
